                        WEDDING STORY:
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        If you're like I was two years ago, you will have no idea what the title of this story means. If you don't know what that strange word means, then just read the next few paragraphs. Believe me, it can literally be a life-changing event for you, as it was for me, and I think it'll be time well spent.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        My introduction to the Cybelian lifestyle began innocently enough, as most important things do. My first sight of the woman who was to become my wife came when I walked into a college classroom. I had enrolled in a night class that was to be a "writers' workshop." The students would learn, hopefully, to write in a manner that would not only help them improve their lives, but might even help them launch careers as published authors. That last part had been my motivation for spending the money required to enrol in the course, as I'm sure it had been for my classmates. I don't know if they actually achieved that goal or not, or whether, like me, they have been side-tracked into something else that was far more fulfilling, and infinitely more exciting, than merely putting their thoughts on paper for others to read.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The woman who was scheduled to teach the workshop was a well-known author, and as I sat waiting with the other students for her to make her appearance, a sense of excitement filled the room. All of us were sure that she'd be able, in short order, to instil in us the knowledge and skills that we'd need to soon join her on the list of published authors, and after that we'd all be living on easy street. That thought was certainly appealing to me, because my Bachelor of Arts degree, supplemented by my Master of Arts one year later, had done nothing to improve my financial standing.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        When the woman at last walked through the doorway, the room fell silent, and I was sure the others were just as entranced by her as was I. She was stunningly attractive, as I had known she would be from the photograph on her book jackets. There was an air about her, though, that could not be captured by a mere camera, and that was her appearance of being completely in charge. It was more than just an "appearance," though, as we were all to learn as soon as she placed her armload of books on the desk, and then without pause, began to tell us just exactly what we were going to learn, and how much better off we'd be for it.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I don't know why the others were so attentive to our teacher's words, but for me, it was a very simple thing. You see, I'd been searching my entire life for a woman who would be "in charge," and who would be the one who could, and would, make all the decisions. I instantly recognized that this lovely woman had that characteristic, and knew that the gods had given me one last chance to find happiness in life. All my earlier attempts at finding my life mate had proved fruitless, even those that at first blush looked promising. In every case, the woman had not been as authoritative, as controlling, as demanding of me as I craved her to be. Now that I'd found what could very well be the answer to my prayers, I vowed to not miss the chance.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        After the two-hour session had come to an end, I gathered with a few other students around her desk, then waited patiently for them to have their questions answered. One by one they left the room, until at last only the woman and I were left. She was seated at the desk, and looked up at me, waiting for me to give voice to my question. I was unable to speak for several seconds, though, because I was rendered utterly speechless by her beauty. Her raven-wing hair flashed with highlights of deep purple in the light from above, and her obsidian eyes sparkled with good humour as she regarded me standing there in confusion. What truly flustered me, though, was that she had offhandedly leaned forward to gather up the books she'd brought, and that caused her low-neckline blouse to open even more, revealing the swell of her magnificent breasts.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Like many men, I have always been fascinated by those particular parts of the female form, and always have difficulty tearing my eyes away from them. To have such wondrous globes partially revealed to my gaze was enough to strike me dumb for an awkward amount of time, a pause broken at last when she arched her eyebrows, then asked, "Did you have a question?" That revived me sufficiently to allow me to stammer out, "Ms. __, could you recommend one of your books over all the others, as demonstrating the writing style you want us to learn?"
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        My wife told me many months later that the courteous way in which I addressed her was the first thing about me that drew her attention. She said that was what made her pay attention to me, rather than just brush me off as she usually did with more-brazen males. She also told me that she had been just as interested in me as I was in her, although for opposite reasons. Whereas I'd been searching for a truly dominant woman, but had yet to find one, she had been equally frustrated in her quest for a truly subservient man. She has often said that many men will pretend to be in that category, but when push comes to shove, their true natures show themselves, and they try to take charge. That had always been her cue that it was time to resume her search for the perfect male, and, like me, she had done so many times. Now, she thought that she recognized something in me that meant her search had at last come to an end.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        She immediately took charge, much to my relief, by saying, "Let's go to the cafeteria for a cup of tea, and we can have more time to chat." So, saying, she gathered up her materials, then left the room. At no time did she wait for an acknowledgment, or ever look back over her shoulder to see if I was following. I guess she instinctively knew that it was up to me to either pass or fail this first test, and thank the powers that be, I meekly walked along behind her.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        That set the pattern for the remainder of the workshop, and for its ten sessions, we would go to the cafeteria afterwards to sip our tea and talk about whatever came to mind. She always led our conversations, of course, and that made me so happy that I simply couldn't bear the wait between our visits. Those waits disappeared at the end of the last session, though, when she said, to my immense delight, that she wanted me to come to her house for dinner the next evening. That's exactly the way she put it, too. It was not so much an invitation as an expression of what she wanted, and expected, to happen. And it did. I showed up on her doorstep right on time, with a bottle of wine in one hand and a bouquet of red roses in the other.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        That night was the beginning of our sexual relationship, although it would definitely be considered a strange one by most other people on the face of the Earth. You see, she never allowed me to remove my clothing, no matter how hot and heavy we were going at it. She never made any attempt to undress me, and I never could bring myself to do it on my own. Her own clothes, in contrast, were quickly removed after we started making love, and when I saw her completely nude, I was so lost in lust that I had no thoughts other than touching, kissing, licking, and sucking whichever parts of her magnificent body she would present to me. If I had any thoughts of actually having intercourse with her, she squelched them by saying, several times, that she was "saving herself for her marriage night." That was good enough for me, and I never pressed the issue. Of course, given my mental makeup, I wouldn't have done such a thing in any case. She was in charge, not me. Her decisions were final, and I would honour them, no matter how much frustration they caused me.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        It undoubtedly seems odd to most of my readers that, in the six months preceding our marriage, I did not have a single orgasm. That didn't apply to Sharon, though. She was a very lusty woman, and obviously found it very easy to achieve that reward. Many were the nights, especially after I moved in with her two weeks later, that she would cum at least twice, and sometimes even more than that. It always gave me a special sense of satisfaction to know that my puny efforts had given her the release that women earn just by being women. Of course, I longed for the time when she would allow me to also climax, but that part didn't seem to interest her. She would ride my tongue, seemingly for hours, but never once did she even touch the clothing over my crotch. She would lie on the couch, with me on my knees beside her, worshipping her wonderful breasts while she pleasured herself with her fingers, and never once reach a hand down to grip my raging erection. I fantasized about her doing that, knowing that would be all that was needed to grant my own release. It never happened, though, and after a few weeks I came to realize that it probably wouldn't.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        After we had lived together for several months, Sharon broached the subject of marriage. We were in bed one night, with her completely naked and me completely clothed as usual, except for my shoes, of course. I was flat on my back worshipping her treasure as she sat on my mouth. As seemed to happen nearly every time we were in that position, she had to run to the bathroom just a couple of minutes later, and had then hurriedly returned as soon as she'd flushed the toilet. I had barely had time to take a few licks of her delicious vagina, when she lifted up, and in the illumination provided by the nightlight in the hallway, I could see her looking down at me. She asked, "What are you trying to say?"
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I hadn't even realized I had made any kind of sound whatsoever, but she again said, "You were mumbling something. What were you trying to say?" I knew then that my throat must have unconsciously tried to give voice to what I'd been thinking at that particular time, for many weeks by then. There was no way for me to hide anything from her, especially when asked a direct question, so I said sheepishly, "You taste so good."
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        She squatted there above my head for so long that I was sure she had been offended by my comment, but my fear disappeared as she asked, "Do you think my pussy tastes better when I get back from the bathroom?" Again, it wasn't in my power to not answer her, and I stammered, "You always taste wonderful. When you come back from the bathroom, it's even better."
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Again, she paused, as if silently considering an important matter, and given what she then said, that must have been exactly the case. Her extremely-exciting question spoke to all the hopes, dreams, and fantasies I'd been having for years, and I almost broke out crying with the overwhelming relief that came from knowing I'd at long last found my soulmate.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        She said in a husky whisper, "I saved some for you. Do you want it?"
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I nodded my head in the dim light, hoping that would be sufficient answer for her, but she instead whispered angrily, "Say it, damn you!"
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        So, I did. I struggled with my frozen throat, then at last was able to gasp out, "Yes! Please! I want it!"
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        That was apparently the answer she was waiting for. She merely moved forward onto my mouth once again, then with a throat that was surely as tight as my own, whispered, "You'd better not make a mess in my bed. Now open your fucking mouth and drink it!"
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Again, I almost lost consciousness as understanding swept over me that at long last, I'd found a woman who loved me enough to do the perverted things I'd wanted for many years. I barely had time to open my lips to their greatest extent before I heard her sigh deeply, and then the hot, bitter flavour of her golden nectar burst across my taste buds.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        She stopped her stream, giving me time to swallow her gift, then when she felt my lips part once again, continued with the most-exciting thing that had ever happened to me. I was so lost in lust that I have no memory of how many mouthfuls she gave me to drink, but at some point, she whispered again, "Now lick it clean, toilet." Since it was beyond my ability to disobey her, I did just that, and kept providing that service as her hips began to buck and her crotch pressed so tightly against my face that I was sure she was trying to smother me.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Her orgasm was surely the best she'd had at any time during our months-long relationship, and it seemed to last an eternity. At last, though, it came to its inevitable end, and she slumped forward, supported by her outstretched arms. Even that position was too much for her exhausted body to sustain, and she collapsed on the bed beside me.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        She lay there for a long time, struggling to gain control of her breathing. At last she said, "I think it's time for us to talk about getting married." It was in no way a question, and no answer was required from me, which was good, since I had been stunned by her words. She continued, "Have you ever heard of the word Cybelianism or The Cybelian lifestyle?"
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        That did require an answer, and I replied, "No. I've never heard that word."
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        She then said, "Go turn on the computer. You need to see something." As difficult as it was for me to tear myself away from her, I forced my body to get out of the bed and take the couple of steps necessary to reach the office area of her bedroom. I pressed the power buttons on her computer and monitor, and soon the room was suffused by the bright glow of the screen. She then joined me there, completely at ease with her nudity, as always.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I was instructed to open the browser, and then to type in the URL for “Cybelianism”. As soon as the page had begun to load, the only thing I had eyes for was the photograph in the upper-right corner, which showed a woman and her husband engaged in an activity that had been my primary fantasy for as long as I can remember. The naked woman was sitting on the front edge of a toilet, with her equally-naked husband lying on his back on the floor right in front of her. She was giving him her hot, bitter, golden nectar, and he was eagerly drinking it, just as I'd done a few minutes before.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Sharon gave me a few seconds to gaze in total concentration at the photo, then she told me to click the link that read, "The Cybelian Marriage." When the new page came up, she said, simply, "Read it." I did, and my life changed forever.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        In the space of just a few minutes, I passed from not even knowing there were such people as Cybelians, to understanding that I had secretly been one for many years, and was at long last discovering my true destiny. All the things I had dreamed of, and fantasized about, were spelled out on that page as being not only suggested, but required by wives and husbands who were in that type of marriage.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I read of the wife being totally and completely in charge; of the husband being required to remain naked at all times when in the house, with his genitals securely in bondage and a dog collar locked around his neck; of his being subjected to physical punishments at the whim of his wife, including whippings and other types of extreme sexual tortures; of his being constantly cuckolded by his wife, and not only forced to watch, but to actively participate during the time his wife was being penetrated, and most especially immediately afterward when she needed to be licked clean; and last but not least, that his primary function was to serve as his wife's toilet, constantly making himself available for her use and relief.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        By the time I finished reading those words, I was literally out of my head with arousal and lust. Everything I had ever fantasized about, almost from the time I'd passed puberty, was not only a part of a Cybelian marriage, but was strictly required. And that type of marriage seemed to be what Sharon wanted for us. My chest was so tight that I could barely draw breath; my throat was completely locked up, to the point I couldn't even swallow; most of all, though, my little penis was harder than it had ever been, and I knew it was leaking a constant stream of pre-cum.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I had paid women to do those things to me several times in the past, but it was always evident that they did them only because of the money. When I realized that Sharon wanted to do them because she loved me, it was all I could do to not yell for joy and sweep her into my arms and tell her how very, very much I loved her in return. I didn't do any of those things, though, but remained frozen in the chair.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The silence was broken at last when she leaned over and hugged me, then whispered, "Do you want that as much as I do?"
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I struggled to speak, gasping for breath. Finally, after clearing my throat several times, I was able to utter a tremulous, "Yes."
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        She then said, "Good. I thought you would. I've already made the arrangements for the ceremony to be held on Saturday night. As soon as we're married, we can get started on all those things. I think we've waited long enough, don't you?"
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Again, I had to clear my throat before I was able to speak, but was finally able to give my two-word answer, gasping out, "Too long!"
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        She then hugged me tightly, then said, "I love you very much, honey. Ever since I first saw you, I just knew we were a perfect match. We're going to have the best Cybelian marriage ever, aren't we? God, I just can't wait to do all those things." In confirmation of her words, I said in a trembling voice, "You don't have to wait."
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        She laughed softly, then said, "I know, sweetheart. It's just that it'll be so much better after the ceremony, when you're really and truly my property. I've been planning all the things I'm going to do to you, and thinking of them when you're eating my pussy. You probably didn't know that's why I've been cumming so much, did you?" She laughed again, more loudly this time, then said, "Okay, turn it off and let's get back to bed. I have some more plans to make."
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        So, I did, and we did, and judging by the very-intense orgasm she had after that, she must have thought of some very interesting things, indeed.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The revelations I've detailed above occurred on a Wednesday night, and the three intervening days were, without question, the longest in history. All I could think about was how wonderful it would be to be nothing but my wife's property, hers to do with as she chose. Again, and again I thought of what it would be like to be cuckolded by her, and to be forced to serve her afterwards. Fantasy after fantasy flashed through my fevered brain as I thought of being whipped by this beautiful woman, then being subjected to more and more extreme sexual tortures. But most of all, I thought of the endless hours I would be forced to spend beneath her beautiful body, serving her in the most intimate manner any man could imagine. By the time Saturday evening actually arrived, I was almost out of my head with arousal and lust, and it required every ounce of my remaining concentration to drive us safely to the home where the marriage ceremony would be conducted.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Sharon had told me that the person who presided at the ceremony would be a Priestess of Cybele, fully empowered to join us in marriage. By then, I simply didn't care who would marry us; I just wanted it to be over and done with, so didn't give any more thought to the subject. I was concerned with what would come after we were married, much more than the ceremony itself.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        At Sharon's direction, I parked in the driveway in front of a large house in an exclusive subdivision outside the city where we live. I'm sure the place cost a lot of money, but again, I was interested in only one thing, and didn't pay much attention to it. We walked to the front door, and to my surprise didn't knock or ring the doorbell, but just went right in. In answer to my look of surprise, Sharon said, "I've been a member of this church for several years, honey. I don't need to knock." As with all other things she told me, I easily accepted her words, and gave the matter no further thought.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        We stood in the foyer, as if waiting for something to happen, and soon something did: a nearby door opened, and a man walked through and approached us. He immediately fell to his knees in front of Sharon, then took her hand and kissed it before saying, "Welcome to the house of Cybele, Mistress. If you will join the Priestess now, I'll prepare your slave for the ceremony."
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Without a glance in my direction, or even a reassuring word, Sharon left us. I stood there in silence as the man regained his feet, then trailed after him when he said authoritatively, "Follow me." I was so used to doing Sharon's bidding without question that it never occurred to me to resist in any way, but meekly entered another room where he led me.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        As soon as the door had closed behind us, he said curtly, "Strip." That did cause me to hesitate, and he just stood there looking directly at me, as if waiting for some sign of disobedience. It seemed as if I had no power to do that, and instead, began to remove my clothing as ordered.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Soon I stood before him entirely naked, embarrassed by what was happening. My embarrassment turned to humiliation, however, when he looked directly at my crotch, then sneered and said with disdain, "And for that she chose you over me?" The scorn in his voice was mixed with a tone of personal injury, and I was sure that at one time he had been Sharon's lover, but she had rejected him. Oddly enough, that knowledge made me glow with pride, and, secure in the belief that she preferred me to him, I merely stood there.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        He must have realized he had no alternative but to accept Sharon's choice, for he said nothing further about it. Instead, he began to instruct me on my part in the ceremony. That part was actually very minor, for apparently all I had to do was fall to my knees as soon as I had reached the altar, then remain there for the remainder of the time. I was told to make replies of acceptance and agreement at the appropriate times, and beyond that, to just follow the orders of Sharon and the Priestess. That seemed simple enough, and I was sure that, even in my befuddled state of mind, I could play my part with no problems.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I was then led to another closed door, and we stood there in silence for several minutes. At last I heard the strains of "The Wedding March," and as if that were the signal he was waiting for, the man opened the door. He grunted, "Go," and I did my best to walk in a dignified manner toward the altar at the front of the room. As you can undoubtedly imagine, that was a very difficult thing to do, given the fact that I was naked, while everyone else in the room was fully clothed. It took my best efforts at concentration to make my stubborn body actually move my feet toward the intended destination, but they must have done so, because my next clear memory is of standing directly before the altar, then, as instructed, dropping to my knees.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        At that moment I heard approving sounds and subdued applause from the five pairs of women and men who were seated in the chairs behind me, and turned to see Sharon being escorted down the aisle by the same man who had so shortly before told me what would be required of me during the ceremony. Her beauty simply stunned me, and I had eyes for nothing or no one else in the room other than my bride-to-be.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        She was wearing a pure white wedding gown, and the contrast with her glistening black hair and obsidian eyes, as well as her brown skin, was more than enough to entrance everyone there. I watched in rapture as she slowly approached me, her arm linked to her escort's. It seemed an eternity before she finally reached my side, and it was only when I turned to face forward once again that I realized another person had entered the room at the same time.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The woman who stood before us was about twice Sharon's age, and those added years seemed to give her even more authority than my beloved. She stood there in silence until the music ended, then cleared her throat in an imperious manner, as if demanding strict silence. When she began to speak, her air of command was even more evident, and I knew that this had to be the Priestess Sharon had spoken of.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        It was obvious that the Priestess had conducted this same ceremony many times, for she spoke with accustomed ease, beginning with somewhat the same words that could be heard at any other wedding, but with key differences.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        She said, "We are gathered here, in the presence of Gaia, to join this woman, our sister, Sharon, and her slave, Glenn, in holy matrimony. Sharon has sworn to me that her slave is here of his own free will, and willingly submits to a life of bondage as the property of his wife. I now formally ask this male if that is true. How do you respond, slave?"
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I had already been told how to properly address each and every woman in the church, and with no hesitation, I replied, "It is true, Mistress."
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        She continued, "Do you, Sharon, enter into the state of Cybelian matrimony willingly, knowing the responsibilities it entails?"
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Sharon's response came as quickly as had mine, and it was, "I do, Priestess."
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The Priestess then asked, "Will you, Sharon, keep this male as your slave, subjecting him to all the humiliations and punishments that he has earned by being born a member of the inferior sex?" Again, Sharon answered quickly, saying, "I will."
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The Priestess' final question to her was then asked, and as those words passed her lips, my growing excitement reached such a peak that I could no longer prevent my tiny penis from beginning to erect. Her words were, "Will you use this slave for your own pleasure and relief, forcing him to serve as your personal toilet, as required by the rules of our Order?"
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I could hear the slight trembling in Sharon's voice as she replied, "I will, Priestess," and knew she was feeling the same arousal, excitement, and lust as I, and that knowledge released any inhibitions I'd had. My penis could no longer be restrained, and in seconds it was standing at full attention.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The Priestess then looked down at me, her scorn at my inability to control myself evident for all to see. She then began to ask me the same type of questions as those she'd so shortly before directed at Sharon. Her first was, "Will you, slave, exist only to serve your wife in whatever way she requires?"
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I whispered through my tight throat, "I will, Mistress," and she continued, "Will you, slave, cooperate in your own cuckolding if and when your wife chooses to do that, and use your tongue, your lips, and your mouth to clean her afterwards?" Again, I struggled to give my answer, and again it was, "I will, Mistress."
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Her final question was similar to the one she had put to Sharon, and it was, "Will you, slave, serve as your wife's personal toilet, using your mouth, your throat, and your stomach to give her the relief she needs, whenever and wherever she requires it?" I was shaking like a leaf by the time she said the final word, and I'm sure my voice was trembling when I said, "I will, Mistress."
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The Priestess then said words so ordinary that they were almost stunning in their unexpectedness. She said, "You may now kiss the bride."
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I had received no instruction telling me what to do at that point, and didn't know whether to stand to kiss Sharon, or if she would kneel beside me. My indecision ended when she turned to face me, then slowly lifted the hem of her skirt, until as last her treasure was revealed to my stupefied gaze. That she was wearing no panties was wondrous enough, but there was something else there that completely froze me in place: her pubic hair had been entirely removed after we had been separated, and I was seeing her beautiful treasure revealed in all its glory for the first time ever.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        It took the Priestess' rebuke to awaken me from my stupor, and luckily it was enough to make my body turn toward my bride, and then lean forward to kiss that most-entrancing part of her body. I held the kiss, hearing the applause and words of approval from the audience in the background, and probably would be there yet if Sharon had not stepped back, then turned to face those seated there.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Following her cue, I shuffled my knees so that I could also turn to face her friends, and we held that position until the applause subsided. When the room was once again silent, the Priestess directed a question to my bride, asking, "Do you plan to cuckold your husband?" With no hesitation whatsoever, Sharon responded, "Yes, Priestess. Whenever and wherever I can find a real man." That brought forth more applause, as well as light laughter from the women and men seated before us, and then out of the corner of my eye I saw the Priestess' hands move to Sharon's back. The sound of the long zipper being pulled downward was all the confirmation I needed that something I'd fantasized about for many years was at last going to be made real.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        As soon as the zipper had reached its lower limit, the Priestess slid the wedding gown off Sharon's shoulders, and I watched mesmerized as it slowly fell to the floor. Even though I'd seen her lovely body many times in the nude, this was the first time I'd seen her in that condition in public, and even more exciting than that, with no pubic hair. I knew the others felt the same, for their exclamations of approval could be heard in the background.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Sharon looked down at me, with a beatific smile on her face, saying, "Now I'll show you why I chose him for Best Man, honey." She then turned to her former escort, and with no preliminaries began to undress him. In almost less time than it takes to tell, he was standing there just as naked as we were, and she was caressing his rapidly-hardening penis.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I hadn't noticed that two of the men in the audience were approaching us, carrying something between them, but when their movements drew my attention, I saw they were bringing a small, padded table to the front of the church. They sat it down behind Sharon, and when she placed her backside against one edge of the thing, then leaned backwards, I knew exactly what was about to happen.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        As I had hoped, when her back was resting on the tabletop, she drew her legs up, then bent her knees above her body. She placed her hands on her knees, then spread them to their widest extent while drawing them even further toward her head. The view that was presented to me, as well as to everyone else in the room, was beautiful beyond compare. I've always believed that the sight of a sexually-aroused woman has no equal, and that's exactly what I saw then. Her nipples were erect, and I knew from long experience they would be super-sensitive when in that condition. The glistening highlights of her treasure were further evidence of what she was feeling right then, and I knew that if I were only allowed to lick and suck her there, my reward would be a mouthful of her delicious juices.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The Best Man needed no further encouragement, and he quickly positioned himself between my wife's widespread legs. The Priestess took his rampant manhood in one hand, guiding it expertly to its rightful place. As I watched the engorged head disappear between Sharon's pouting lips, I knew she was feeling a satisfaction that my little pee-pee could never give her.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        There was no question that the Best Man had been chosen well. His cock appeared monstrous to my untutored eyes, and I couldn't stop myself from thinking that he was easily twice the size of my puny five inches. I'm sure that's undoubtedly an exaggeration, but not by much. Even more than the disparity in length, though, was the fact that the distance across his huge cock was more than twice my inadequate one inch.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Sharon confirmed my opinion of her satisfaction by sighing deeply, then saying, "God, I love it when you fuck me." She then fell silent, giving her complete attention to the enjoyment of feeling a real man deep inside her. In just a few seconds, her body began to rock back and forth, moving in the rhythms of aroused women since time immemorial. Judging by my limited experience in pleasuring her, I knew she was just seconds away from reaching her reward, and that was confirmed when her breath began to come in gasps. She looked down at me, kneeling there beside her, said, "I love you, honey," and then with a hiss I had always loved to hear, said, "Ohhhh! Jesus. . .H. . . . Chrisssssttt!"
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Her lover could not long resist the pleasure he'd been feeling while fucking my bride, and with one final thrust to bury his monster as deeply inside her as possible, he cried out, "Fuuuccckkk!" After an eternity of cumming in the inner recesses of her womb, his body went limp and he placed his hands beside Sharon, obviously needing their support.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        At last, the lovers were able to breathe again, and to the cheers and applause of the assembled onlookers, they kissed deeply. The Best Man stood straight, then began to slowly withdraw his slightly-softer penis from my wife's vagina. With a soft sucking sound, the head at last fell free, although they were still joined by a rope of semen that seemed to stretch endlessly, before it too broke free of her body.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Sharon looked down at me once again, then said softly, "Honey, I need you now."
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I don't know that I've ever moved faster than I did right then. My knees shuffled quickly, moving me to the position so recently vacated by her lover, and I knelt there transfixed by the sight I'd only dreamed about before. Her pouting lips were still bright red, almost as if glowing from the heat of their coupling. Her clitoris was still more than a little erect, which signalled her continuing excitement. Her vagina was still gaping open, almost as if inviting the man to once again invade it. But most of all, though, the single most exciting part of her body was the thick cum that was slowly oozing from where it had been deposited just seconds before.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I needed no second invitation from her to know what was expected of me, and almost as if it were beyond my ability to control it, my head bent forward and I began to do my duty. From first lick to last swallow surely consumed an eternity's worth of time, for there seemed no end to what she was feeding me, and I still marvel at the quantity of their combined juices that she allowed me to lick and suck from her body. That wonderful time did come to an end, of course, even as much as I hoped it never would, and when I felt the Priestess' hands pulling me back, I didn't resist. However, when I was at last able to tear my eyes away from my bride's lovely body, I saw the other five men standing there, all as naked as the Best Man had been, and all with engorged cocks of their own. I knew that the most-exciting night of my life had barely begun.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The second man wasted no time in positioning himself between her thighs, and with the practiced assistance of the Priestess soon had his member buried to the hilt in Sharon's treasure. What he had witnessed only minutes before must have had much the same effect on him as it did me, for he began to moan in the space of half a dozen strokes. His orgasm was signalled, as with the best man, by his final thrust forward and a gasp for one final breath. I knew that my bride hadn't also climaxed, but that she was enjoying the stimulation anyway. She acknowledged my existence then by reaching down with one hand and patting the top of my head, almost as if saying, "Good little doggie."
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        When her second lover also pulled away, I waited for my cue to move between her legs and do my duty once again. Instead, she said, "Give him a double load." The others standing there evidently knew what that meant, for the third man quickly moved to where I longed to be. Once again, the Priestess guided another man's rampant manhood to my wife's pouting lips, and soon her third lover of the night was giving her the pleasure that is every woman's right. As with the other two, his orgasm started with one final thrust, followed by his long, drawn-out groan.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        When he moved away from her crotch, Sharon silently told me what was expected by merely pointing to the oh-so-exciting place where she wanted me. Almost before her hand could move back to her side, I was once again licking, sucking, and swallowing as if I were starving. I guess that's probably a fairly accurate assessment of my condition right then, because I felt a craving so deep within my body that I was sure it would never be satisfied.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I've never been able to assert, from that first experience to the present, that the taste of another man's semen is anything resembling "good." However, when it's mixed with my wife's overwhelmingly-delicious juices, it fulfills a need within me that is nothing less than an addiction. Sharon has forced me to swallow semen "straight from the tap," as she puts it, on many occasions, and it takes every ounce of my willpower to not draw away in disgust from the man's penis as it begins to spurt its slimy load into my mouth. But just let the same disgusting stuff be placed in her treasure, and it instantly becomes nothing less than the food of the gods. I love it.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        As soon as I had finished withdrawing my second snack from her vagina, my bride said, "Okay. I want the other three of you to fuck me just as fast as you can. I've got lots of other things planned for him, and it's getting late." She said those words with a sweet smile on her face, all the while gazing at me with an expression of love on her face. I don't know that I've ever loved her more than I did right then, but about ten minutes later, as she was feeding me her triple load of cum, had to be a close second. I loved being cuckolded then, and still do now. Even though two years have passed since that night, I still get an extra-special thrill in my chest when I watch another man making love to her.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Sensing that I had once again done my duty to her, Sharon said, "Okay, honey. I think you got all there is. Stand up now."
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I obeyed her without thinking, and then stood there in respectful silence as she sat up, then with the help of two of her lovers, regained her feet. The others resumed their seats in the chairs, then sat there silently, waiting for whatever was to come next.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Sharon began to speak then, saying, "I think everyone here can see why I need other men to satisfy my needs." As she spoke those words, she pointed to my crotch, where my tiny penis was standing erect and bobbing frenziedly, as if hoping that it, too, would be allowed to pleasure my wife. The others laughed and nodded in confirmation of her assessment of my ability to give her pleasure, while I stood there in shame and humiliation, loving every second of it.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        She turned to me and continued, "Honey, you've seen what I need in a man, and you surely know that you don't qualify. It's because of your tiny size that I've decided you'll never have sex with me, or any other woman, for that matter. I know all my friends agree with me, too." The chorus of, "Yes. Damn right. Fucking 'A,' and other sounds of agreement were all that was needed to tell me their opinions. I knew they were right, for the evidence was right there in front of all of us, standing out from my crotch and bobbing up and down like a crazed metronome. If Sharon had asked for my opinion, I would have agreed with her, but she didn't. She'd made her decision, as was her right as my wife, and that was that.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        When the room once again was silent, she again looked directly at me and continued, "I've decided that since you're not a real man, anyhow, there's no reason for you to ever cum again. And since it's my decision alone, then that's the way it'll be. I hope you really enjoyed your last orgasm, whenever you had it, because you're never again going to do that." She paused again as the chorus of approval rang from the audience, and I knew my fate was sealed. Not only would I never be allowed to make love to my wife, but I'd also been sentenced to a lifetime of frustrated arousal. As strange as it may seem to you, dear reader, that knowledge did nothing but make me even more excited.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Everyone in the room but me must have known what was about to happen, because not a word of instruction was given before two of the men stood and left through a door behind the altar. When they returned, they were pulling a wheeled cart, and sitting on the cart was a large plastic tub that appeared to have water in it. As they approached us, I could see there were dozens of ice cubes floating on the water, but that gave me no clue as to what was about to happen.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I had more than a clue, though, when the other four men approached me. Again, with no direction, two of the men took my arms and pulled me over backwards. The other two gripped my ankles, lifting my feet from the floor. Then, holding my wrists and ankles in their firm grips, those parts of my body were raised higher and higher, until I was held horizontally about four feet above the floor. My body was rigid, which was not what Sharon wanted, for she said, "Honey, just relax. Let your butt fall."
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Again, I had no choice but to obey her, and so I willed my muscles to go limp. Soon my midsection slumped downward, and my body was in the shape of a "U." I knew by then what was planned for me, and when Sharon's command to, "Put him in there," was heard, I tried to steel myself for the shock I'd feel when my crotch was immersed in the ice-cold water. That didn't help much, though, and when my overheated backside met the freezing water, I couldn't stop myself from crying out.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Sharon said severely, "Hush! We don't want to hear your fucking whining. Just shut up and try to act like a man for once."
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        So, I did, although it didn't get much easier to bear.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The men continued to hold my ankles and wrists, dangling my crotch in the tub. Time seemed to crawl as Sharon expectantly watched my penis, but it couldn't have been much more than a couple of minutes before she said, "Okay. The little thing's all soft now. Get him on the table."
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Again, I was lifted by the four men, this time high enough to place my body on the table where my bride had been so shortly before. With no hesitation, the Priestess pinched the head of my dick between her thumb and forefinger, then stretched it as far above my crotch as she possibly could. The poor little thing was completely soft, but was easily an inch longer than it had ever been when hard. The sickening part, though, was that its diameter was surely no greater than a drinking straw. Again, I knew that my inadequacy was on display for everyone there to see.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Sharon moved her hand toward my stretched pee-pee, and I saw she was holding something that looked like a brass cylinder, about 1/2" in diameter and maybe 4" long. On closer inspection, I saw that the thing had been fashioned from a latticework of brass rods, no more than 1/16" in diameter. I knew then that she had loved me enough to make the cock cage herself, for that's undoubtedly what the thing was.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        You see, Sharon is not only an accomplished writer, she's also quite talented in the world of art. Specifically, she creates freeform sculptures using metal rods, mostly those made of brass. I knew that she had secretly made the cage just for me, knowing it would be required on our wedding night.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The cage was actually fabricated in two halves, as she demonstrated by hinging them apart along the vertical axis. As I knew was about to happen, she placed the two halves around my member, then closed them. A tiny catch was then engaged to hold the two halves together, and it was secured forever by an equally-small padlock. That left only some way to keep the thing from falling to the floor when I stood, but she had obviously thought of that, also.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        As I lay there on the table, my arm and legs held widespread by the four men, Sharon cupped my frozen balls in one hand while holding the cock cage in position with the other. At that same moment, the other women gathered around me, some kissing me and breathing in my ears, while others caressed my body. The most exciting part of all, though, came when two of them began to pinch and pull my useless nipples. I've always thought those parts were more sensitive than even the head of my penis, and that fact was demonstrated almost immediately by the thrill I began to feel in my crotch. I knew then that nothing would be required to fasten the cage to my dick; it would provide that part all by itself as it came erect.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I watched in fascination as the stretched shaft of my little dick began to swell as the blood rushed into it. The pinching fingers of the Priestess kept the head from following suit, and soon the shaft was almost twice as large as the glans. I felt, as well as saw, my engorging penis come into contact with the cock cage. Then, an even more exciting view was presented as the flesh continued to grow until it actually began to protrude through the openings in the thing. In just a few more seconds, my little dick looked more like a waffle than a penis.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Seeing that my member was firmly trapped by the cock cage, the Priestess released her grip on the head, and I watched it spring back slightly. The most exciting part of the whole process began then, as the head, along with the small part of the shaft that was not inside the cage, began to swell to what would have been their normal dimensions when I was hard. Soon there was what looked to be a red golf ball riding atop the imprisoning thing Sharon had made for me, and everyone knew it would remain that way until she chose to release me.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        As my bride stepped back from the table, so did her friends and the Priestess. She said to me, "Get up now, honey. It's time for us to go home. I just can't wait another minute to do all those things I've been planning for you." The tone of excited anticipation in her voice was evident to me, and probably to everyone else in the room.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The moment I had regained my feet, she took my arm in hers and began to escort me up the aisle, in the opposite direction we'd walked that eternity of time before. Her friends were applauding us, and shouting words of encouragement to her to, "Give it to him, Sharon," "Teach him what it means to be a man," and, "Remember all the things you promised to do to him." The words that caught her attention, as well as mine, were, "When are you going to start training him?" That brought her up short, and she turned to face her friends, still standing around the table.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The room grew quiet once more, and she said, "I've been training him for a couple of months now. You'll never know how proud I am of how quickly he's learning to be a human toilet."
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        One of the women scoffed, then said, "Surely you're making that up, sweetie. It took me six months to get Jim to drink even one mouthful, and almost a year before he'd swallow everything, I had for him." That brought words of agreement from the other women, and other examples of how long it'd taken to train their own husbands.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Again, Sharon waited until the noise subsided, then said, "You don't understand how very special he is. I've never known a man to progress as quickly as he did, and that makes me very proud of him." Her words simply stunned me, and then as my brain absorbed them, my chest swelled so much with pride that I could barely draw breath.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        That was the last thing she said to them, and we once again hurried up the aisle, then entered the foyer. Our clothes were draped across chairs there, and we wasted no time in getting dressed, and hurrying to her car, sure that neither of us could endure the fifteen minutes the drive would require.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The drive home was made mostly in silence, and I'm sure my bride was just as lost in thought as was I. Just as I was thinking of all my fantasies, hoping they'd be made real during the hours to come, so she was undoubtedly reviewing her plans for me. The only words we exchanged came when she asked if I had liked her friends, and I responded with a wholehearted, "Yes!" I then asked her if the men were the husbands of the women, and she laughed before replying, "Of course not. Slaves aren't allowed to have sex with other women, and some not even with their wives, like you. Those men were all members of the church who are used for stud service. We're always on the lookout for men with big cocks, and never lose the opportunity to recruit them. By the way, if you ever come across a man who has a big dick, you must tell me so I can check him out. We always need new blood in the church." I nodded my understanding, then concentrated on getting us safely back home.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        As I pulled into the garage, Sharon was already unbuckling her safety belt before the car had come to a complete stop. By the time I could press the button to close the overhead door, she was standing outside the vehicle, waiting impatiently for me. She literally dragged me through the door, then brought me to a stop right inside it. She said sternly, "You're never to pass this point unless you're naked. Take off your clothes now and hang them neatly in the closet. Place your shoes on the floor of the closet, in the exact center. If I ever see your stuff looking messy, I'll punish you."
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I actually thought of not doing her bidding then, just so she'd punish me. All I needed to do, though, was to see her flushed face and rigid nipples poking through her blouse to know that kind of treatment was already in store for me, regardless of what I did or didn't do.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        As soon as my clothes had been placed neatly in the closet, she once again gripped my hand in hers. We almost ran up the hallway, both eager to get on with what she'd promised to do to me. The third door from the garage had always been locked during the months I'd lived in Sharon's house, and I'd never had the nerve to ask her what was behind it. I knew right then that my questions were to be answered, because she brought us to a halt at that point. After taking a key from her pocket, she unlocked the door, then said, "I want to show you something, honey. We're going to be spending lots of time down here, so you'd better get used to it." With an evil smile on her lovely face, she pushed the door open, then turned on an overhead light.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        In the glare of the lamp, I saw a stairway leading down, and for the first time ever, realized there was a basement beneath her house. I'd never before known there was such a thing on the property, and the understanding that she'd been hiding it from me until it was needed did nothing but add to the excitement I was already feeling.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        We hurriedly descended the steps, then stopped at the bottom, seemingly in nothing more than a small storage room that was about 12' on each side. There were shelves along two of the sides, and they were filled with everyday, mundane items. The third side had a large table, and it was covered with boxes that were filled with soil, with what looked to be mushrooms growing in it. I knew only disappointment then, for in my fevered imagination we had been descending to the torture chamber that she'd prepared for me, and where we'd spend many happy hours. All I could do was stand there, wondering just what it was she intended, but too timid to ask any questions.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        She left me in confusion for several seconds, then said, "Do you know what those mushrooms are?" Since all mushrooms look alike to me, I replied, "No, Mistress." She then laughed before saying, "They're Psilocybins. Ever heard of those?" I had heard of them, and knew they were not only hallucinogenic, but also illegal to possess. That part worried me more than a little, for I definitely didn't want my wife to be involved in anything like that. I nodded in answer, and then when she glared at my lack of respect for her, said softly, "Yes, Mistress."
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        She then went on to explain why such a thing was growing in her basement, saying, "Just in case the cops ever search the house, they'll probably break through the door that leads down here. Once they see these mushrooms, they'll be so distracted by that evidence of law-breaking, they'll stop looking for anything else. That means they won't find this."
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        She smiled again, then with no further words, walked to the wall beside us, which looked to hold nothing more than several items of clothing on hangers, each hooked over a wooden closet rod.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        It was such an ordinary thing to see in a storage room that I simply couldn't fathom her purpose. However, understanding exploded in my brain when she moved some of the clothes to the side, then did something with her hands that I couldn't see. I heard the click of a catch releasing, and then part of the wall hinged away from us. I knew then that the small room in which we were standing was not all there was to the basement; the darkened space behind the secret door must hold whatever it was that she intended for me, and the mystery and anticipation made my crotch throb with such a renewed intensity that I thought maybe it would simply explode as more and more blood tried to force its way into my constricted penis.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Sharon reached inside the opening, and must have clicked a light switch, for the hidden area was immediately illuminated. She made her way through the new doorway, then turned to me while saying, "Get your ass in here, you worthless little wimp!" I hurried to obey, then stood there on a small platform in stunned silence as I saw things I'd only dreamed about before this night. She had to push me aside in order to reach back through the opening to rearrange the clothes so they would conceal the hidden door, and then to close it behind us. As it clicked into place once again, she stood beside me with one arm over my shoulders, and joined me in looking at all the toys there.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Her impatience would not permit such a delay for long, and she again took my hand and pulled me with her down the six steps between us and the floor level of the torture chamber. I had never before seen a basement with such a high ceiling, surely at least ten feet from the blood-red carpet to the glaring-white ceiling. The reason for the extra height became obvious when my eyes alighted on something in the center of the room, and its placement told me in no uncertain terms that it was not only the center, but also the focus of the chamber.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        What I saw was a short length of wood, probably four inches square and four feet long, dangling horizontally at shoulder height. There were wide leather cuffs attached to each end of the beam, and an eyebolt had been fastened to its center. Attached to the eyebolt was a steel cable, which ran to a pulley directly above it in the ceiling, and from there over to another pulley close to the wall. The cable completed its path by then going straight down to an electric winch mounted on the wall. As my brain at last understood what my eyes were telling it, I knew that an important part of my most extreme fantasies was there before me.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Sharon husky voice broke through my reverie, and I turned to look at the most-wonderful person in the whole world: my bride, who would surely, in the space of just a few moments, have me suspended in front of her and be doing to me all those things I'd only dreamed of before. She was saying, "Isn't it beautiful, honey? Do you like it?" I could only nod my head in answer, until after clearing my throat several times, I was able to gasp out, "Yes! I love it, Mistress!"
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I longed for her to take me to the spot directly below the beam, where there was a circle cut out of the carpet, exposing the concrete floor, which had been painted a matching red. The floor drains directly under where I would be hanging gave me a feeling of supremely-exciting dread, as I thought of its purpose. I had eyes for nothing else in the entire room, and felt nothing but disappointment when she said, "I want to show you everything. I've been planning and building my torture chamber ever since I bought this house five years ago. I just knew that someday I'd find you, and I wanted to have everything ready so we wouldn't have to wait even a single day." Her exciting words overcame my fixation with the suspension area, and when she took my hand to lead me to a display panel on the wall, I went willingly.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The panel held nearly every item of bondage, discipline, and torture that I had read about and imagined for more than ten years, and especially during the past six months, while Sharon was riding my tongue. She lovingly explained the use of each thing there, and I responded when she required it, until she picked up the final item in the display. She held the thing up for my examination, then said, "This is something I've wanted to use on a man for as long as I can remember, but I never could find one who I was sure wanted it as much as you do. I guess that part wouldn't really matter, though, would it? Now that you're my property, I'll do whatever I want."
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The thing she was holding wasn't all that familiar to me, although I did know what it was. I guess I'd never thought such a thing would be used on me, and now that I knew it would be, I felt more than a little fear. You see, what she had was called a "strap-on dildo," and I'm sure I don't need to explain it's use. Suffice it to say that when Sharon donned the thing, I would soon feel sensations I'd never before had. To be honest, I have to admit I was feeling just as much excitement as fear right then, although that part was undoubtedly due to the extreme state of arousal I'd been in for hours without end by that time. When the time came that she actually deflowered me with her strap-on, several weeks later, that level of excitement wasn't present. Even given that, though, it was still much more pleasant than when she told one of her lovers, a few days after that, to "give him the real thing now."
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        She next led me to two long boards which had been fastened to the wall in the shape of a large "X." I'd seen many pictures and read enough stories to know that apparatus was called an "X-beam," and those same experiences gave me all the information I needed to know how it would be used. After allowing me to stare at the thing for several seconds, giving me time to imagine my stretched body secured there, and subjected to all the wonderful things she would then do to me, Sharon said, "There's one more thing for you to see, honey." Once again, she took my hand, escorting me to the far corner of the room.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The torture device that was sitting on the floor in the corner was such a simple thing, but so very, very exciting to me. I had looked at pictures of that very device on the Internet many times, always imagining what it would be like if a woman were to introduce me to its use. I was in such a state of suspended animation right then that it took me several seconds for my fevered brain to understand that Sharon was speaking to me. She was saying, "Do you know what that is honey?"
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Again, all I could do for a long time was nod my head, while staring avidly at what was sitting there before us. In reality, it was nothing more than a small oak chair, resembling an oversize child's potty chair. What made it different, though, and so much, much more exciting was the network of leather straps dangling below the opening in the seat, which I knew would be used to secure my head in position. The two cuffs affixed to each of the front legs would be used to hold my wrists there, preventing any possibility of escape. Finally, I was able to gasp out, "Yes, Mistress! It's a bondage toilet!"
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        She put one arm around my shoulder, then drew me close and kissed me more passionately than I'd ever imagined possible. There was no question that she was just as excited, just as aroused, just as filled with lust as I was as we both imagined me being held there, and her sitting on the throne taking her relief. My poor little penis tried its best to stand up, but even though the blood tried to fill it, as it'd always been able to do before, the cock cage wouldn't permit it. The best the tiny thing could do was move away from my crotch for a few degrees, then hang there bobbing in frustration.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        After the longest kiss I'd ever had came to an end, Sharon was just as breathless as I. She struggled to regain control of her voice, then said, "I've had that here, waiting for us, ever since you moved in." She then looked deeply into my eyes then, and paused for a long time before continuing, "Using that chair to train you is the second most-exciting thing I can think of doing right now. The first would be training you without needing to use it at all." Again, she paused, then asked so softly that I could barely hear her words, "We won't really need to use it, will we, honey?"
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I felt a deep sense of disappointment right then, but it was immediately swept away as I thought of what her words implied. Just the thought of my beautiful bride sitting on my face, forcing me to open my mouth to its widest extent while she relieved herself in it, was an order of magnitude more exciting that being strapped and cuffed in place beneath the chair. I knew that taking her gifts directly from her body would be so much more intimate, and in the end, so much better for both of us, that there was no question what my answer would be. I said, in an equally soft voice, "No, Mistress. We won't need it."
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        That ended our time in the torture chamber for that night, which in some ways was very disappointing to me. In other more important ways, however, what we did in our wedding bed a few minutes later was far, far more arousing and more satisfying to both of us. All in all, those wonderful minutes had to rank very high on the all-time list of good wedding nights.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        That night set the tone for our marriage, and we've lived ever since in wedded bliss. I love being my wife's property, in every way imaginable, and serving her in every way imaginable. Many are the nights we've spent in our secret room in the basement, with me suspended by either my wrists or my ankles, with her giving me the sort of punishments I deserve. Equally exciting are the nights when she brings one or more of her lovers to our home, and then takes her pleasure from them. I've never tired of seeing her passion at those times, and of sharing in her joy as she achieves orgasm after orgasm. My appetite for the combined juices she feeds me after she has been inseminated has never waned, but to the contrary has only increased. As I wrote above, I have never come to like the taste of semen directly "from the tap," as she calls it, but somehow when she's the one who is guiding her lover's penis into my mouth, it's entirely acceptable. I guess it's a case of my knowing that anything she wants me to do is just the way things are supposed to be, and I can not only accept them, but even learn to enjoy them.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        There is one other thing that has become an important part of our marriage, and Sharon wants me to tell you about it.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        She trained me to accept the cock cage for extended periods of time, and I soon learned to do so. I loved the feeling of confinement it gave me, and the throbbing pain in my crotch as the blood tried to force its way into my little dick. I especially enjoyed seeing the swollen, bright-red head on the end of the cage, knowing that condition somehow enhanced the wonderful pain I felt when she pushed needles through it. What I didn't enjoy, though, was the searing agony I felt whenever I tried to pee through the constriction of the cage. Since that was something, I had to do several times each day, given that I was doing it for both of us, I came to dread that full feeling in my bladder that told me it was time to visit the bathroom once again.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Sharon felt a great deal of compassion for my suffering, but said she was powerless to not use the cock cage, since its use was mandated by the rules of Cybelian marriage, when the wife had chosen celibacy for her husband. She did say there was a solution to the problem, but for the longest time she wouldn't tell me what it was. She wouldn't, that is, until one time when I was standing in the bathroom, straining to urinate. She was holding my little pee-pee, aiming it at the ring of water in the toilet, as she sometimes did. As I sobbed in agony, she said, "You know, maybe it's time for you to consider eliminating your problem all together. Would you like to do that?"
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Right then, I'd have done anything to be able to pee like I had before our marriage, and I gasped out, "Yes! Please, Mistress! Just tell me what to do."
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        As I finished draining my bladder, she took a piece of toilet tissue from the roll and wiped away the final drop on the swollen head. She said softly, "If you didn't have anything to put the cock cage on, then it wouldn't be a problem, would it?"
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I was struck speechless by what she seemed to be suggesting as a solution to my problem, and unable to respond. In the silence, she asked, "Would you let me do that to you, honey? We could get rid of your little problem if I'd take you to one of the church members. She's a surgeon, and has had lots of experience in solving problems like yours. Is that what you want?"
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Through a throat tighter than it ever had been, I squeaked, "Yes, Mistress! Please!"
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I am Ted Moore and this was how my Cybelian journey began.

                        Please kindly NOTE that if you wish for a Cybelian marriage you should first of all discuss it with your partner and make sure he agrees before letting us know. You can apply for marriage here if you've already discussed with your partner. Kindly note that due to the nature of the lifestyle full consent is required.
