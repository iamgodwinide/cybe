                        The Cybelian marriage is the union of a dominant woman in this case a Cybelian and her slave.
                        In a Cybelian marriage, it is the woman who makes the decision and it is the man's place to submit and obey every command dished out to him.

                        The marriage can either be based on love or not. There are two types of Cybelian marriages:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Loving relationship, and </li>
                        <li>
                            Cuckolding relationship (Non-loving)
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>A LOVING Cybelian relationship is where the primary partner loves her slave, cares for him and in some cases sleep with him or have sex with him. She pampers him even after punishing him.
                        <br />
                        On the other hand, in a Cuckolding relationship, the primary partner(woman) cuckold her husband by having sex with as many men as she desires, letting the men penetrate her bareback if she wishes.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        In a Cuckolding relationship some women may let their husband have sex with them, while many may not - just allowing him to masturbate.
                        <br />
                        Some wives require the husband to let other men use him for sex.
                        <br />
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div >
