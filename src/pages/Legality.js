                    <p>
                        This is a frequently asked question, and the simple answer is NO. Cybelian marriages aren't legally binding in the same way your BDSM contracts aren't legally binding. BDSM contracts are not recognized even if it was written by a lawyer. Cybelian documents are also not recognized by law but only by the Cybelian Organization, its members and the high priestesses of the Cybelian Temples.

                        Please note, you will never be able to take any Cybelian contract documents after you've been wedded by the High Priestess to a court and make your slave perform his duties or stay with you. This is because consensual slavery is not legally binding in any jurisdiction. The document holds moral authority within your relationship and within the Cybelian community. In other words, you are able to enforce a Cybelian contract if the slave is still happy for it to stand or as long as the slave is still a member of the Cybelian organization.

                        If he (a slave) is not willing or wish to not be a part of the Cybelian organization anymore, then your arrangement isn’t worth the paper it’s written on. Even if the termination clause prohibits the slave(s) from terminating/cancelling, they can still walk away at any time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please note that if you want your contract to have more moral authority you must sign in your own blood in front of the High priestess; marriages done this way have had a high success rate.
